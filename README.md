**Hi, I am Paula** 	ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m a front-end developer passionate about creating applications that are not only easy to use but also aligned with business goals, with a strong focus on UX/UI. I specialize in building smooth, efficient, and user-friendly interfaces using React, JavaScript, and React Native.

I work with technologies like **Node.js, Express, Axios, HTML, CSS, and MongoDB** to deliver complete solutions, always aiming to balance functionality and great user experience. I also design and prototype interfaces using Figma and manage version control with Git and GitHub. My workflow is centered around writing clean, maintainable code, and collaborating effectively with the team.

For me, the best applications are those that solve real problems and provide users with intuitive and meaningful interactions!
